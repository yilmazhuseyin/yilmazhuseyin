### Hi, I am Hüseyin 👋
🚄🏗️ For many years, I worked as a Quality Assurance and Quality Control Engineer on a $2 billion railway project in Africa.

I recently decided to pursue my career in software development and here I am! 👨‍💻 I am currently working heavily on C#. I also wrote an app for kids with Swift and XCode. If this interests you, you can check it from the link below. 

Also it's great to be back in school too! Currently, my "Associate of Science - Computer Programming" education be under way.

Always interested in hearing from former colleagues, managers, or just interesting creative people, so feel free to contact me if you'd like to connect!
